# ðŸ“± MatchMate â€“ Matrimonial App UI (SwiftUI)

MatchMate is a SwiftUI-based iOS application that simulates a modern matrimonial platform. It uses data from the [RandomUser API](https://randomuser.me/) to showcase user profiles in a match card-style layout.

Users can Accept or Decline profiles, with their decisions stored locally using **Core Data**, supporting full **offline persistence**.
